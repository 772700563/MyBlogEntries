# Backtrack Programming in C
Recently, I have discovered a very nice tiny library (just 1 file) called [CBack](http://www.akira.ruc.dk/~keld/research/CBACK/) and developed by [Keld Helsgaun](http://www.akira.ruc.dk/~keld/) that supports [backtrack programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking) in **standard C**. Helsgaun is known in the Operations Research and Computer Science communities for his efficient implementation of the Lin-Kernighan heuristics for the [Traveling Salesman Problem](http://www.akira.ruc.dk/~keld/research/LKH/) (if you do not know this problem, you may look at this [trailer](http://www.travellingsalesmanmovie.com/)).

**CBack** offers basically two functions that are described in [1] as follows:

1. **```Choice(N)```**: "_is used when a choice is to be made among a number of alternatives, where **N** is a positive integer denoting the number of alternatives_".
2. **```Backtrack()```**: "_causes the program to backtrack, that is to say, return to the most recent call of Choice, which has not yet returned all its values_".

With these two functions is pretty simple to develop exact enumeration algorithms.
The **CBack** library comes with several examples, such as the [N-queens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle) problem and the [15-puzzle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle).

Below, I will show you how to use **CBack** to implement a simple algorithm that finds a [Maximum Clique](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clique_problem) in an undirected graph.

As usual, all the sources used to write this post are publicly available on
[my GitHub repository](https://github.com/stegua/MyBlogEntries/tree/master/CBack).

## Basic use of CBack
The **CBack** documentation shows as first example the following code snippet:

```
1:	int i, j;
2:	i = Choice(3);3:	j = Choice(2);4:	printf("i = %d, j = %d\n",i,j);5:	Backtrack();
```
The output produced by the snippet is:

```
i = 1, j = 1 
i = 1, j = 2 
i = 2, j = 1 
i = 2, j = 2 
i = 3, j = 1 
i = 3, j = 2
```

If you are familiar with backtrack programming (e.g., [Prolog](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog)), you should not be surprised by the output, and you can jump to the next section.

The Figure below sketches the program execution.

When the program executes the ```Choice(N=3)``` statement, that is the first call to the first choice (line 2), returns value 1 which is assigned to variable ```i```. Behind the scene, the *Choice* function stores the current execution state of the program in its own stack, and records the next possible choices (i.e. the other possible program branches), that are values ```2``` and ```3```. Next, the second ```Choice(N=2)``` assigns value 1 to ```j``` (line 3), and again the state and the possible choices are stored for later use. Then, the ```printf``` outputs ```i = 1 , j = 1``` (line 4 and first line of output). Now, it is time to *backtrack* (line 5). 

What is happening here?

When the ```Backtrack()``` function is invoked, the algorithm *backtracks* and continues the execution from the most recent **Choice** stored in its stack, i.e. it assigns to variable ```j``` value 2, and ```printf``` outputs ```i = 1, j = 2```. Later, the ```Backtrack()``` is invoked again, and this time the algorithm backtracks until the previous possible choice that corresponds to the assignment of value 2 to variable ```i```, and it executes ```i = 2```. Once the second choice for variable ```i``` is performed, there are again two possible choices for variable ```j```, since the program has backtracked to a point that precedes that statement. Thus, the program executes ```j = 1```, and ```printf``` outputs ```i = 2, j = 1```. At this point, the program _backtracks_ again, and consider the next possible choice, ```j = 2```. This is repeated until all possible choices for ```Choice(3)``` and ```Choice(2)``` are exhausted, yielding the 6 possible combinations of ```i``` and ```j``` that the problem gives as output, as shown in the figure above.

```Choice(N)``` and ```Backtrack``` use two **threatening** C standard functions, ```setjmp``` and ```longjmp```. For the details of their use in CBack, see [1].

## A Basic Maximum Clique Algorithm
The reason why I like this library, apart from remembering me the time I was programming with [Mozart](http://www.mozart-oz.org/), is that it permits to implement quickly exact algorithms based on enumeration. While enumeration is usually disregarded as _inefficient_ ("_ehi, it is just brute force_!"), it is still one of the best method to solve small instances of almost any combinatorial optimization problem. In addition, many sophisticated exact algorithms use plain enumeration as a subroutine, when during the search process the size of the problem becomes small enough.

Consider now the **Maximum Clique Problem**: Given an undirected graph $$$G=(V,E)$$$, the problem is to find the largest complete subgraph of $$$G$$$. More formally, you look for the largest subset $$$C$$$ of the vertex set $$$V$$$ such that for any pair of nodes $$${i,j}$$$ in $$$C \times C$$$ there exists an arc $$${i,j} \in E$$$.  

The well-known branch-and-bound algorithm of Carraghan and Pardalos [2] is based on enumeration. The implementation of Applegate and Johnson, called [dfmax.c](ftp://dimacs.rutgers.edu/pub/dsj/clique/dfmax.c), is a very efficient implementation of that algorithm. Next, I show a basic implementation of the same algorithm that uses **CBack** for backtracking.

The Carraghan and Pardalos algorithm uses three sets: the current clique $$$C$$$, the largest clique found so far $$$C^*$$$, and the set of candidate vertices $$$P$$$. The pseudo code of the algorithm is as follows (as described in [3]):

```
1:	function findClique(C, P)
2:		if |C| > |C*| then C* <- C  // store the best clique
3:		if |C| + |P| > |C*| then
4:			for all v in P // the order does matter 
5:				P <- P \ {v}
6:				C' <- C u {v}
7:				P' <- P  \intersect N(v)  // neighbors of p
8:				findClique(C', P')
9:
10:	function main()
11:		C* <- {}  // empty set, C* global variable
12:		findClique({},V)
13:		return C*
```
As you can see, the backtracking is here described in terms of a recursive function. However, using CBack, we can implement the same algorithm without using recursion.

## Maximum Clique with CBack
We use an array ```S``` of $$$n$$$ integers, one for each vertex of $$$V$$$.
If ```S[v]=0```, then vertex $$$i$$$ belongs to the candidate set $$$P$$$; if ```S[v]=1```, then vertex $$$i$$$ is in $$$C$$$; if ```S[v]=2```, then vertex $$$i$$$ cannot be neither in $$$P$$$ nor in $$$C$$$. The variable ```s``` stores the size of current clique.

Let me show you directly the C code:

```
   for (v = 0; v < n; v++ ) { 
      /// If the current clique cannot be extended to a clique
      /// larger than C*, where LB=|C*|, then backtrack
      if ( s + P <= LB ) 
         Backtrack(); 
      if ( S[v] < 2 ) {  /// Skip removed vertices  
         /// Choice: Either v is in C (S[v]=1) or is not (S[v]=2)
         S[v] = Choice(2);   
         if ( S[v] == 2 ) { /// P <- P \ {v} 
            P--;  /// Decrease the size of the candidate set 
         } else { /// S[v]=1: C <- C u {v}
            s++;   /// Update current clique size 
            if ( s > LB ) { 
               LB = s;  /// Store the new best clique
               for ( w = 0; w <= v; w++ ) 
                  C[w] = S[w]; 
            } 
            /// Restrict the candidate set 
            for ( w = V[v+1]; w > V[v] ; w-- )  
               if ( S[E[w]] == 0 ) { 
                  S[E[w]] = 2; 
                  P--; /// Decrease the size of the candidate set 
               } 
         }  
      } 
   } 
   Backtrack(); 
```
Well, I like this code pretty much, despite being "_plain old_" C programming.
The algorithm and code can be improved in several ways (ordering the vertices, improving the pruning, using upper bounds from heuristic vertex coloring, using induced degree as in [2]), but still, the main loop and the backtrack machinery is all there, in a few lines of code!

Maybe you wonder about the efficiency of this code, but at the moment I have not a precise answer. For sure, the ordering of the vertices is crucial, and can make a huge difference on solving the [max-clique DIMACS instances](http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~fmascia/maximum_clique/DIMACS-benchmark). I have used CBack to implement my own version of the Ostengard's max-clique algorithm [4], but my implementation is somehow slower. I suspect that the difference is due to data structure used to store the graph (Ostengard's implementation relies on bitsets), but not in the way the backtracking is achieved. Although, to answer to such question could be a subject of another post.

In conclusion, if you need to implement an exact enumerative algorithm, [CBack](http://www.akira.ruc.dk/~keld/research/CBACK/) could be an option to consider.
